# tech-blog

This application allows users to view, edit and delete blog posts. Upon first visit, the user is presented with a main page that contains all existing blog posts. Clicking on any of these posts will open a page that displays only that post in addition to any of its comments. From here users can add comments to posts, provided they are logged in.

Login and signup functionality allows users to create accounts and sign into them via a previously established password.

Once logged in, users can view their "Dashboard" which contains all posts they have previously created. From here they can update existing posts, create new ones or delete them.
